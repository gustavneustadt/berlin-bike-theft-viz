				According to <a href='https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/570624/umfrage/fahrraddiebstaehle-und-aufgeklaerte-faelle-in-deutschen-staedten/' target='_blank'>data</a> from the Bundeskriminalamt (Federal Criminal Police Office) Berlin had the most Bike Thefts in 2021 of all german cities with 25&thinsp;438 thefts reported. But Leipzig had reported the most <a href="https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/165154/umfrage/fahrraddiebstaehle-in-deutschland-2009/">Bike Thefts relative to the population</a>; Berlin only takes the 16th place in this regard.\n
				
				The Berlin Police provides an Online Service for citizens: the <em>Internetwache</em>. Citizens are able to report crimes, ask questions or pay their penalties. Since September 2021, the police have been testing a free and open access to daily updating bicycle theft data of the city, starting from January 2021. \n
				
				This Visualisation Project uses this data provided by the Berlin Police Department and shows you some insights into it. The police publishes new data every day at 12:00 am.

				This data shows you the mean damage per week in terms of money and amount of thefts in berlin at the top and the data of the current week at the bottom. Because new data gets published every day at 12 am, the graph may show you the data from last week.\n

					We can now assume, that the most thefts happend at 17:00. \n
					
					The color only shows the different groups of items. Items with a higher probability gets a more vibrant yellow. This gets clearer when we take a look on all reported thefts …

						For this visualisation I filtered the data to only show thefts that happened in less than 12 hours to improve the clarity. \n

						At the moment, the dataset contains only data of 2021 and 2022. That means, that this graph might be not as precise — it might be a good idea to give it another look in one or two years. ;-)
